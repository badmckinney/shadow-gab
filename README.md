# Shadow Gab

A real-time chat web application utilizing web sockets.

## Goal

This is a fun project I decided to expand on in order to challenge myself to learn a new technology. Being that my focus was to implement and understand web sockets better, there are some pieces missing from this project that I devoted less focus to.

## Build Status

Shadow Gab is running and fully functional, but a work-in-progress. As stated above, there are features missing, such as session storage and proper error handling that would make the project more complete.
