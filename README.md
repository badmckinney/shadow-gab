# Shadow Gab

A real-time chat web application utilizing web sockets.

## Goal

This is a fun project I decided to expand on in order to challenge myself to learn a new technology. Being that my focus was to implement and understand web sockets better, there are some pieces missing from this project that I plan to add over time.

## Technologies and Frameworks

**Built with**
- Socket.io
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

## Tests

Tests can be run by using the **npm test** command from the terminal
